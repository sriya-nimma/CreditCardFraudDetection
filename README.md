# CreditCardFraudDetection

**Problem:**

To develop a machine learning model aimed at identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. The primary objective is to build a classifier capable of accurately identifying transactions that exhibit behavior indicative of fraud.

**Data Used:**

The dataset utilized in this project was sourced from credit card transactions and consisted of various numerical features representing transaction characteristics. Due to privacy concerns, the specific features were anonymized and transformed (V1, V2, to V28). The dataset included a binary target variable, 'Class,' indicating whether a transaction was fraudulent (Class=1) or legitimate (Class=0).

**Methods:**

The combination of data loading, pre-processing, cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation provided a comprehensive approach to tackle the problem of fraud detection in credit card transactions
